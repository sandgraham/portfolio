				<h1>Weird Beers</h1>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>A family run purveyor of fine beers from all over the world, Weird Beers was looking for a referential site that was both modest and evocative of their artistic, hand-crafted brand. The result is a design featuring stylized line drawings, smooth transitions, and clean, easy to find presentations of the essential information clients are looking for. Additionally, I created a small Javascript based static site generator for the occasional inventory or news update.</p>

				<h1>Gene's Liquor</h1>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>Gene&#8217s Liquor is a Los Angeles based distributor of rap and house music. Their pride as a source of gritty, bare bones art was an essential quality to convey in their online shop. I created a custom Big Cartel theme, stripping down the store to the most minimal of necessities. This is a brand that doesn&#8217t hide behind anything; their products do all the talking. I tried to let that edginess show through while still offering an ultra smooth, all-device spanning experience that would be dead simple for customers to navigate.</p>

				<h1>Fractured Atlas</h1>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>Fractured Atlas is a non profit that offers a range of financial services to artists through convenient web apps. One of those services is Fractured U, intended to educate members on fiscal matters in the arts sector with a curated collection of video lectures. As a software development intern I was tasked with working with two other interns to redesign and rebuild the Fractured U web app in Ruby on Rails. I worked predominantly on the admin section where I created a LDAP authentication service based on the Devise gem in order to leverage Fractured Atlas&#8217s already existing employee accounts. That service was later implemented into all of Fractured Atlas&#8217s apps. I worked on a few iterations of the admin panel interface as well as the design for the database, before delivering a fully functional prototype that other employees were able to use. I also had a chance to fix some bugs and add a few features to the Artful.ly web app. Ultimately, it was a great chance to gain experience in prototyping and building a new web app as well as maintaining a large, already in use code base.</p>

				<h1>CK-12</h1>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>CK-12 creates and distributes open source textbooks. The ambitious non-profit offers highly customizable and interactive textbooks to teachers and students for free. As an an intern I worked mostly in Javascript, using different libraries to create interactive lessons that could be embedded into the HTML versions of textbooks. Specifically, I used a library called JSX to create and debug a series of geometry lessons, fifteen total, for introducing students to axioms, postulates, and shapes. The lessons needed to function in a small space on a page competing with images and text, and with almost no room to describe the interactions they needed to be immediately intuitive. As such, I worked with the Math content team to build a symbolic vocabulary that progressed in complexity in each interactive lesson. My internship at CK-12 allowed me a great hands on experience in Interactive Design through a rapid cycle of iterative prototyping and user-testing.</p>

				<h1>Random Maps</h1>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>As a senior year thesis I studied fractal and randomization algorithms for use in generating unique content. The result was a random map generator built in Javascript and output to the Canvas element. I was able to study opportunities for optimizing Javascript in order to create maps, with resolutions into the thousands, in hundredths of a second. I also looked into how the raw data could be translated into multiple forms of output, forms not as obvious as arrays of height maps, including natural-language, 3d printing, and graphic design. I found something very pleasing in using a uniform virtual process to generate something uniquely physical.</p>
