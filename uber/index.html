          <p>
            In May of 2019 I joined Uber to work on a new company wide design
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had wanted to implement a design system since my days as the lone
            designer and developer at
            <a href="/scalefunder" target="blank">ScaleFunder</a>, where I was
            always looking for ways to be more efficient when building out new
            products and features. One of the concepts I came across, which at
            that moment was just starting to coaelsce in the tech vernacular,
            was this idea of a "design system". I remember redesigning
            ScaleFunder's admin panel using a very naive design system based on
            Sketch templates, BEM, and Sass mixins. It was pretty rough. Since
            then, the tools for creating and managing a design system have
            evolved quite a bit (React, Figma, etc).
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of working on something that unites both design and
            engineering, in practice and operationally, has always seemed very
            appealing to me. Design systems are now an integral piece in
            frontend efficiency, even for small projects. The concept has
            created clear ways for designer/developer types like me to provide
            value to an organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the opportunity came up to work on a new system for Uber, I had
            to give it a shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Base design system spans multiple platforms (Figma, Mobile,
            Web). My team specifically works on
            <a href="https://baseweb.design" target="blank">Base Web</a>, the
            React implementation of Base, as well as more foundational projects
            like
            <a href="https://www.styletron.org/" target="blank">Styletron</a>, a
            "blazing-fast" CSS-in-JS library. You may notice that both projects
            are open source- one awesome facet of our work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uber has a suprising number of web applications. There are around a
            thousand interal apps, covering use cases such as mapping,
            monitoring, and data-modeling, in addition to some fairly critical
            consumer facing apps you may have heard of: Freight, Eats, and a PWA
            version of Rides.
